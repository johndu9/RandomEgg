RandomEgg
=========

What we do is pull links for almost every single product under all categories from Newegg. The Java bits generate the lists of links, and the rest is website stuff.

Mitch and I wrote the website bits to make it look pretty, all of which are also included in the git, so feel free to host the site if you want.

A working demo of the site is available here: www.randomegg.me
