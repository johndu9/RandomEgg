RandomEgg
=========

What we do is find a bunch of subcategories by pulling from Newegg's site map because I'm way too lazy to copy and paste every subcategory into a file myself. This is also great for finding something new to get someone for any occasion if you're completely out of ideas. This is also Mitch's fault because he doesn't know what he wants for Christmas.

Mitch and I wrote the website bits to make it look pretty, all of which are also included in the git, so feel free to host the site if you want.

A working demo of the site is available here: http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~du55/

We also plan on making a randomizer for individual product pages in the future.
